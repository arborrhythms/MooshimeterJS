# Mooshimeter-JS

This is a port of the Python Mushimeter code.
It is designed only as proof of concept.
When it runs successfully, temperature data from a mushimeter will be printed at stdout.

On Windows, it will require drivers compatible with noble.js, please see the GitHub repository on that software for more information.

Directions:

1) install noble.js : "npm install noble"
2) make sure you have a compatible bluetooth device
3) "node moosh.js"
